## Kickstarting with Excel



## Overview of Project

### Purpose

-	In this descriptive analysis of Kickstarter campaign’s data, the probing relates to the correlation or certain impact that a campaign's launch date and funding goals could have had on their outcomes. The outcomes for theater and play categories are the specific data examined. Visualizations made by condensing data into charts aides to identify trends. Distilling information about the data also expedites information in order to draw conclusions or limitations of the original probe. 




## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-	Under the parent category, “theater”, the data is sorted out on a time-analysis to facilitate any connection between when the campaign launched and its outcome. The information is displayed in a monthly vantage point, however, data entries for specific years can be filtered. The outcomes are given results such as ‘successful’ and ‘failed’ based on if their goal crowdfunding was attained through pledged donations. Or ‘canceled’ if the campaign terminated their operation. Pivot charts that count grand totals find that there are more successful campaigns overall under this type of subcategory. A distinctive data point is that there’s a peak success trend in the months of May and June, year over year. A line chart is used to apprehend the pivot charts counts and fast-track the relation of what time of year a campaign was launched to its outcome.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-	To further query the prospect of a favorable result, that data has been filtered to display goal-success for the subcategory 'plays'. More clearly, the figures are customized in a chart to indicate the goals of campaigns in relative dollar(currency) ranges. Each range has been constructed to count its corresponding totals for goal-to-pledged end results; these being how many successful, failed, and canceled campaigns there were per range. This allows the calculation of total projects per range, which in turn can support finding averages of how close campaigns were to meeting their goal. The chart arrays for percentages of successful, failed, or canceled performance in relation to campaign’s funding goal amount. A line chart visually projects these end results. The data shows that there were zero canceled campaigns and lower to moderate funding goals have a higher probability of success. This is displayed by the convergence that occurs at a range of 15000 to 19999 units between the successful and failed proportion curves. A discredit of this trend is the upswing of net successful campaigns that surges at a range from about 35000 to 44999.    



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- A possible drawback that could have been encountered would have been incomplete data of outcomes. The initial Kickstarter data does not entail what a project's donation threshold was before it 'canceled'. This could create a skewness in the results and assumptions could be wrongly made about the amount goals should be and their relative success. Information about campaign's checkpoints could reveal further tools for future campaign's evaluation of their own progress. 
 
- Furthermore, a challenge about the two analyses between Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates and Outcomes Based on Goals is that the main subject of research differs among the two. The time analysis probes the parent category of 'theaters', which emcompasses many subcategories, while the  analysis about proportion of  success relative to goal amount inquires the subcategory of 'plays'. This different types of examination can deter conclusions and correlations. A possible solution would be a third or fourth analyses that incorporates both types of studies for both the parent and subcategory. This could provide stable premises useful to exact-match crowdfunding initiatives.  






## Results



- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

 Conclusions can be made that mid-year launches are probable to success. Also, that theater types of kickstarter campaigns have a higher chance of being successful in attaining goals than other outcomes. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the data, there is a consistent expectation that lower to moderate goal amounts are likely to succeed. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Limitations of this data is that the population number could be more substantial and extend to more recent years. As stated in the above in the description of challenges encountered, is that a specific scope or category was not used to survey both a time-analysis and a goal-based outcome. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis there is a kink in the trend for lower goals and their favorable succcess rate. The data could be examined the structure of the distribution of the data and for possible outliers.
